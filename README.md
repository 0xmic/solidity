# Notes on Solidity  
Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.  

Solidity was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).  

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types among other features.  

With Solidity you can create contracts for uses such as voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, and multi-signature wallets.  

When deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of Solidity. This is because breaking changes as well as new features and bug fixes are introduced regularly.
