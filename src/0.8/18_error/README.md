# Error  
An error will undo all changes made to the state during a transaction.  
You can throw an error by calling `require`, `revert` or `assert`.  
* `require` is used to validate inputs and conditions before execution.  
* `revert` is similar to `require`. See the code below for details.  
* `assert` is used to check for code that should never be false. Failing assertion probably means that there is a bug.  
Use custom error to save gas.

contract Error {
	function testRequire(uint _i) public pure {
		// Require should be used to validate conditions such as:
		// - inputs
		// - conditions before execution
		// - return values from calls to other functions
		require(_i > 10, "Input must be greater than 10");
	}

	function testRevert(uint _i) public pure {
		// Revert is useful when the condition to check is complex.
		// This code does the exact same thing as the example above.
		if (_i <= 10) {
			revert("Input must be greater than 10");
		}
	}

	uint public num;

	function testAssert() public view {
		// Assert should only be used to test for internal errors,
		// and to check invariants.

		// Here we assert that num is always equal to 0
		// since it is impossible to update the value of num
		assert(num == 0);
	}

	// custom error
	error InsufficientBalance(uint balance, uint withdrawAmount);

	function testCustomError(uint _withdrawAmount) public view {
		uint bal = address(this).balance;
		if (bal < _withdrawAmount) {
			revert InsufficientBalance({balance: bal, withdrawAmount: _withdrawAmount});
		}
	}
}
```

Here is another example:
```

pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Account {
	uint public balance;
	uint public constant MAX_UINT = 2**256 - 1;

	function deposit(uint amount) public {
		uint oldBalance = balance;
		uint newBalance = balance + _amount;

		// balance + _amount does not overflow if balance + _amount >= balance
		require(newBalance >= oldBalance, "Overflow");

		balance = newBalance;

		assert(balance >= oldBalance);
	}

	function withdraw(uint _amount) public {
		uint oldBalance = balance;

		// balance - _amount does not underflow if balance >= _amount
		require(balance >= _amount, "Underflow");

		if (balance < _amount) {
			revert("Underflow");
		}

		balance -= _amount;

		assert(balance <= oldBalance);
	}
}
```
