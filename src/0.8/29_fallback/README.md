# Fallback
`fallback` is a function that does not take any arguments and does not return anything.  
It is executed either when
* a function that does not exist is called or
* Ether is sent directly to a contract but `receive()` does not exist or `msg.data` is not empty
`fallback` has a 2300 gas limit when called by `transfer` or `send`.
