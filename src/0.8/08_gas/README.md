# Gas  
### How much `ether` do you need to pay for a transaction?  
You pay `gas spent * gas price` amount of `ether`, where
* `gas` is a unit of computation  
* `gas spent` is the total amount of `gas` used in a transaction  
* `gas price` is how much `ether` you are willing to pay per `gas`  
Transactions with higher gas price have higher priority to be included in a block.  
Unspent gas will be refunded.  
### Gas Limit  
There are 2 upper bounds to the amount of gas you can spend  
* `gas limit` (max amount of gas you're willing to use for your transaction, set by you)  
* `block gas limit` (max amount of gas allowed in a block, set by the network)
